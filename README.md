# Quizlog

## What it does
QuizLog is an interactive quiz application that allows users to explore various topics, test their knowledge, and learn new facts. It offers a wide range of quizzes on different subjects, from science and history to pop culture and current events. Users can select quizzes, answer questions, and receive instant feedback on their performance. What sets QuizLog apart is its ability to interact with users as a Chat GPT helper. Specifically, it can learn from conversations and generate new quizzes for students to review later on.

## How we built it
We built QuizLog using a combination of modern web technologies. The front-end was developed using React Native, providing a smooth and responsive user interface across different platforms. The backend is powered by AWS Lambda (API) and AWS EC2 using Node.js and Express (Cartesi Decentralized Database), handling quiz data. We used Cartesi as a decentralized database to store and update quiz content. The app is hosted on a cloud server for scalability and performance.

## Challenges we ran into
During the development of QuizLog, we encountered several challenges. One of the main challenges was designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface that would cater to users of all ages and backgrounds.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud not only of our app's functionality and exceptional user interface but also of its ultimate goal. QuizLog's ultimate goal is to create a publicly accessible decentralized quiz bank for students across the globe. With the help of Cartesi infrastructure, this goal can be achieved without compromising scalability or stability.

## What we learned
Throughout the development of QuizLog, we learned valuable lessons in user interface design, real-time application development, and database management. We gained insights into the importance of user engagement and feedback to continuously improve the app.

## What's next for QuizLog
In the future, we plan to expand QuizLog by adding even more diverse and challenging quizzes. We aim to incorporate machine learning to personalize quiz recommendations based on users' interests and performance. Social features, such as the ability to challenge friends and share achievements, are also on our roadmap. Ultimately, we aspire to make QuizLog the go-to platform for students to enhance their educational journey.
